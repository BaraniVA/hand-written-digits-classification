Handwritten Digit Classification using MNIST dataset and TensorFlow

This repository contains a simple Python script that uses the TensorFlow library to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 

The script loads the data, normalizes it, creates a simple feedforward neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, compiles the model with a loss function and optimizer, trains the model on the training data, and then evaluates the model on the test data.

Prerequisites:

You need to have TensorFlow and Numpy installed on your system.

To install:

pip install tensorflow

pip install numpy

Built With:

TensorFlow - The deep learning library used

Numpy - The numerical computation library
